# Simpl
A Scratch Addons preset made for developers that have previously used Unity or other engines.

## Installation
1: Install the simpl-sa-preset.json file from the MAIN branch. Then, install [Scratch Addons](scratchaddons.com) from their website. Then, open the Scratch Addons extension and click the settings button in the top right corner. You will be redirected to a configuration website for Scratch Addons. Here, navigate to the bottom left corner and click 'More settings' and then 'Import settings'. Choose the JSON file you downloaded earlier and check your [Scratch Website](scratch.mit.edu). It should be different now. If not, please try again and check the [Scratch Uptime](https://scratch-upptime.netlify.app/).
